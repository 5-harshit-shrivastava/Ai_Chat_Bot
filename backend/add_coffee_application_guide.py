‚Ä¢ 2-4 years old: 3 kg per plant
‚Ä¢ Above 4 years old: 5 kg per plant

Application Timing:
‚Ä¢ First Application: Apply the fertilizer in a 30 cm deep ring around the crop before the monsoon season (pre-monsoon)
‚Ä¢ Second Application: Apply after the monsoon season (post-monsoon). For this application, ensure weeds and vegetative debris are completely turned under and buried in the soil, and any stumps are removed"""
