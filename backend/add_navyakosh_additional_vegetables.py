‚Ä¢ Dosage: 100 grams of Navyakosh Organic Fertilizer per plant
‚Ä¢ Timing & Method: Apply at the base of the plant 45 days after seedling transplantation

Mechanism of Action:
Active microorganisms in the fertilizer (Mycorrhiza (VAM), Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria, Azospirillum, Potassium Mobilizing Biofertilizer (KMB), Pseudomonas, etc.) get activated and help plants to get and utilize all macro and micronutrients throughout the crop cycle.

Note: For Cucumber, application is required two times throughout the crop cycle.

CARROT

Application:
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 4-5 bags per acre
‚Ä¢ Method: Apply using a broadcast pattern
‚Ä¢ Timing: During seedbed preparation

Mechanism of Action:
Active microorganisms in the fertilizer (Mycorrhiza (VAM), Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria, Azospirillum, Potassium Mobilizing Biofertilizer (KMB), Pseudomonas, etc.) get activated and help plants to get and utilize all macro and micronutrients throughout the crop cycle.

Note: For Carrot, this fertilizer is required only once throughout the crop cycle.

RADISH

Application:
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 4-5 bags per acre
‚Ä¢ Method: Apply using a broadcast pattern
‚Ä¢ Timing: During seedbed preparation

Mechanism of Action:
Active microorganisms in the fertilizer (Mycorrhiza (VAM), Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria, Azospirillum, Potassium Mobilizing Biofertilizer (KMB), Pseudomonas, etc.) get activated and help plants to get and utilize all macro and micronutrients throughout the crop cycle.

Note: For Radish, this fertilizer is required only once throughout the crop cycle.

CABBAGE

Application:
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 50 grams of Navyakosh Organic Fertilizer per plant

Mechanism of Action:
Active microorganisms in the fertilizer (Mycorrhiza (VAM), Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria, Azotobacter, Potassium Mobilizing Biofertilizer (KMB), etc.) get activated and help plants to get and utilize all macro and micronutrients throughout the crop cycle.

BRINJAL (EGGPLANT)

1st Application:
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 50 grams of Navyakosh Organic Fertilizer per plant
‚Ä¢ Timing & Method: Apply at the base of the plant during seedling transplantation

2nd Application:
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 100 grams of Navyakosh Organic Fertilizer per plant
