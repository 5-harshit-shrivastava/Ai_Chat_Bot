WHEAT

1st Application:
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 4-5 bags per acre
‚Ä¢ Method: Apply using a broadcast pattern
‚Ä¢ Timing: During land preparation, just before sowing the seeds

Second Dose (For Irrigated Crops):
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 2-3 bags per acre
‚Ä¢ Timing: Apply 45-60 days after sowing, immediately after weeding

Mechanism of Action:
Active microorganisms in the fertilizer get activated and help plants absorb and utilize all macro and micronutrients throughout the crop cycle.

Key Microorganisms: Azospirillium, Azotobacter, Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB), and Sulphur Solubilizing Bacteria (SSB).

PADDY (RICE)

1st Application:
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 4-5 bags per acre
‚Ä¢ Method: Apply using a broadcast pattern
‚Ä¢ Timing: During land preparation, just before sowing the seeds

Second Dose (For Irrigated Crops):
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 2-3 bags per acre
‚Ä¢ Timing: Apply 45-60 days after sowing, immediately after weeding

Mechanism of Action:
Active microorganisms in the fertilizer get activated and help plants absorb and utilize all macro and micronutrients throughout the crop cycle.

Key Microorganisms: Blue-green algae (Anabaena), Azolla algae, Azospirillum, and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB).

MAIZE (CORN)

1st Application:
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 4-5 bags per acre
‚Ä¢ Method: Apply using a broadcast pattern
‚Ä¢ Timing: During land preparation, just before sowing the seeds

Second Dose (For Irrigated Crops):
