Q1: What is Navyakosh Organic Fertilizer, and how is it different from chemical fertilizers?

A: Navyakosh is a 100% organic fertilizer made from natural ingredients like cow dung, agricultural waste, and fermented organic manure. Unlike chemical fertilizers that can leave harmful residues, Navyakosh enriches the soil's natural health and supports sustainable farming by increasing yields while protecting the environment.

Q2: How does Navyakosh improve soil health?

A: Navyakosh contains 60 types of beneficial microorganisms that restore the soil's natural balance. These microbes break down complex nutrients, making them easily available for crops. It also adds significant organic matter, which improves soil fertility and its capacity to hold water.

Q3: Can Navyakosh reduce the need for irrigation?

A: Yes. Navyakosh uses advanced super absorbent polymer technology. These polymers can absorb up to 268 times their weight in water and release it slowly back to the plant roots. This process keeps the soil moist for longer and can reduce irrigation needs by up to 33%.

Q4: On which crops can I use Navyakosh?

A: Navyakosh is a versatile, one-time-use fertilizer suitable for a wide range of crops, including:
‚Ä¢ Wheat, Rice, Maize, Bajra, Jowar
‚Ä¢ Cotton and Sugarcane
‚Ä¢ Pulses
‚Ä¢ Vegetables, Fruits, and Spices

It is designed to be crop-specific, adapting to the unique needs of each plant.

Q5: Is Navyakosh safe for my crops, family, and the environment?

A: Absolutely. Navyakosh is 100% organic and free from harmful chemicals. It does not pollute the soil, water, or air. Crops grown using Navyakosh are safe and healthy for consumption.

Q6: Can I use Navyakosh with other fertilizers or pesticides?

A: Navyakosh is a comprehensive solution designed to meet most of your crop's nutrient needs, which significantly reduces the requirement for additional chemical fertilizers.

Q7: How do I apply Navyakosh to my crops?

A: Apply Navyakosh according to the recommended dosage for your specific crop (e.g., wheat, paddy). After application, it is important to irrigate the field to activate the nutrients and the super absorbent polymers.
