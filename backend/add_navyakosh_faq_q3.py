Q3: Can Navyakosh reduce the need for irrigation?

A: Yes. Navyakosh uses advanced super absorbent polymer technology. These polymers can absorb up to 268 times their weight in water and release it slowly back to the plant roots. This process keeps the soil moist for longer and can reduce irrigation needs by up to 33%."""
