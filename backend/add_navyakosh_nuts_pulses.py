ARECA NUT

Application (For Mature Trees):
‚Ä¢ Method: Dig a ring around the stem, apply the fertilizer, and then cover it with soil
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 2-3 kg of Navyakosh Organic Fertilizer per tree

Note (For Seedlings):
‚Ä¢ Apply 500 grams of fertilizer per plant at the base during seedling transplantation

Mechanism of Action:
Active microorganisms in the fertilizer (Mycorrhiza (VAM), Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria, Azospirillum, Potassium Mobilizing Biofertilizer (KMB), Pseudomonas, etc.) get activated and help plants to get and utilize all macro and micronutrients throughout the crop cycle.

CASHEW NUT

Application (For Mature Trees):
‚Ä¢ Method: Dig a ring around the stem, apply the fertilizer, and then cover it with soil
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 3-4 kg of Navyakosh Organic Fertilizer per tree

Note (For Seedlings):
‚Ä¢ Apply 500 grams of fertilizer per plant at the base during seedling transplantation

Mechanism of Action:
Active microorganisms in the fertilizer (Mycorrhiza (VAM), Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria, Azospirillum, Potassium Mobilizing Biofertilizer (KMB), Pseudomonas, etc.) get activated and help plants to get and utilize all macro and micronutrients throughout the crop cycle.

GROUND NUT (PEANUT)

1st Application:
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 4-5 bags per acre
‚Ä¢ Method: Apply using a broadcast pattern
‚Ä¢ Timing: During land preparation, just before sowing the seeds

Second Dose (For Irrigated Crops):
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 2-3 bags per acre
‚Ä¢ Timing: Apply 45-60 days after sowing, immediately after weeding

Mechanism of Action:
Active microorganisms in the fertilizer (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria, Rhizobium, Azospirillum, etc.) get activated and help plants to get and utilize all macro and micronutrients throughout the crop cycle.

CHICKPEA DAL (CHANA)

1st Application:
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 4-5 bags per acre
‚Ä¢ Method: Apply using a broadcast pattern
‚Ä¢ Timing: During land preparation, just before sowing the seeds

Second Dose (For Irrigated Crops):
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 2-3 bags per acre
‚Ä¢ Timing: Apply 45-60 days after sowing, immediately after weeding

Mechanism of Action:
Active microorganisms in the fertilizer (Rhizobium, Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria, Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (VAM), etc.) get activated and help plants to get and utilize all macro and micronutrients throughout the crop cycle.

SOYA BEANS

1st Application:
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 4-5 bags per acre
‚Ä¢ Method: Apply using a broadcast pattern
‚Ä¢ Timing: During land preparation, just before sowing the seeds

Second Dose (For Irrigated Crops):
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 2-3 bags per acre
‚Ä¢ Timing: Apply 45-60 days after sowing, immediately after weeding

Mechanism of Action:
Active microorganisms in the fertilizer (Rhizobium, Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria, Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (VAM), etc.) get activated and help plants to get and utilize all macro and micronutrients throughout the crop cycle.

TUR DAL (ARHAR / PIGEON PEA)

1st Application:
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 4-5 bags per acre
‚Ä¢ Method: Apply using a broadcast pattern
‚Ä¢ Timing: During land preparation, just before sowing the seeds

Second Dose (For Irrigated Crops):
‚Ä¢ Dosage: 2-3 bags per acre
‚Ä¢ Timing: Apply 45-60 days after sowing, immediately after weeding

Mechanism of Action:
Active microorganisms in the fertilizer (Rhizobium, Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria, Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (VAM), etc.) get activated and help plants to get and utilize all macro and micronutrients throughout the crop cycle."""
